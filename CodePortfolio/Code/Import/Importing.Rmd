# Importing data to R
Basic import commands are very simple. Depends on the file type.
First, need to set the working directory:
```{r}
#must use quotes, and reverse backslashes
setwd("C:/Users/kdebr/Documents/GitHub/Portfolio_KHD_i590/CodePortfolio/Data")
```
Next ensure proper library is accessible. If you're importing from excel:
```{r}
library(readxl)

```
Otherwise:
```{r}
gapminder<-read.csv(file='C:/Users/kdebr/Documents/GitHub/Portfolio_KHD_i590/CodePortfolio/Data/gapminder.csv')

#Check for proper import:
head(gapminder)
```
Notes: reverse backslashes in setwd, but not in read.csv. Specify file='___'. Must use quotes, must include C:/ at the beginning of the path.  

Once data is successfully imported, you can proceed with description/analysis.
